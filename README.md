# About the Project

The objective of this project is to create a website for Taleem Gah, a school that provides education to underprivileged children. The school faces challenges in managing students’ grades and assessing its financial situation, primarily because their records are maintained on paper. This has led to inefficiencies in record-keeping, as well as difficulties in tracking and analyzing financial data and student performance. To address these issues, a proposed website has been developed with two main components. The first component is a financial module that enables the school to review its expenses and donors. This feature allows the school to make informed decisions regarding financial matters. The second component is an academic module that allows teachers and administrators to input and view students’ grades. This feature is intended to provide updates on student performance and enable the generation of student performance reports. This project was completed remotely, with communication established through either Whatsapp or email. Despite the challenges of remote work, the team was able to effectively collaborate
and deliver a high-quality product. The website is now live and accessible via this link: https://taleem-gah-school.onrender.com. The back-end functionality of the website is implemented using Flask, a Python web framework that provides a robust set of tools for building web applications. The front-end functionality is implemented using HTML/CSS/JavaScript, which provides an intuitive and user-friendly interface.

# Expected Deliverables

Our primary objective is to provide an interface to our faculty that will assist them in efficiently
administrating our institution.
We expect a fully operational website, which we can update accordingly from time to time. The
primary objective of the website is to provide an interface:
- that teachers can use to generate student reports at the end of academic terms, which can then be analyzed to gauge student performance.
- that administrators and financial managers can use to view, edit, and remove budgeting data as per their requirements and generate reports that can aid in gauging how to appropriately finance this organization on an annual basis.

Alongside this, we expect detailed documentation that will highlight and outline the expected
deliverables, with clear instructions provided as to how this product is to be operated and maintained.
